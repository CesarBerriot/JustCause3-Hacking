# JustCause3-Hacking
My personal efforts at hacking JC3, with a final goal of scripting the gameplay (as current mods only allow game assets modifications, making modders able to edit textures, models, and gameplay machanic settings).   \
note : [Some efforts](https://github.com/aaronkirkham/jc3-console-thingy/tree/master) towards this goal have already been made to an extent, but the code doesn't do much, clearly was not designed to be read by anyone but the author as the whole architecture is absolute chaos, and is basically unreadeable as magic values are all around the place.

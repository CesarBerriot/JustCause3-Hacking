This is a list of all the valuable strings I could get out of the main JC3 executable.  \
I used SysInternals' [Strings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings), then manually removed false flagged strings.  \
**strings** syntax I used : ``strings64.exe -n 8  JustCause3.exe > found_strings.log``
